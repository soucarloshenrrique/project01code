In this project 01
I created a Portfolio for presentation for my course, good for the first project I think it turned out well.

I know that with time I will improve my skills and make a better website, but I tried to do something simple and objective I hope everyone likes it, because I spent 3x weeks to do it.

for someone with skills maybe it's a lot more for a beginner in this world I think I'm doing well, I hope that in a few months my skills will be even better.

Projects details/Ideas:

In the first session I included some technical language that can be deleted or added further, depending on my learning, my photo will change to a more professional one with a better background.

These colors are the ones I like, blue, black, white, orange, purple, pink.

In the ABOUT part:
I added some details but they will change as I develop in the course with skills, etc.

I added a button where people can download my CV, plus I added a cover letter, which I think is better if I introduce myself first and then if the person is interested, they can talk to me because the email and telephone details are in the letter.

As for projects, over time I will add new ones...

In the footer part, something very simple and objective like where I am and email.


Everyone has a beginning, this is mine, the first project completed on 03/27/2024 at 3:41 pm.
