In this project 01
I created a Portfolio for presentation for my course, good for the first project I think it turned out well, 
I know that with time I will improve my skills and make a better website, but I tried to do something simple and objective I hope everyone likes it, because I spent 3x weeks to do it, 
for someone with skills maybe it's a lot more for a beginner in this world I think I'm doing well, I hope that in a few months my skills will be even better.

Everyone has a beginning, this is mine, the first project completed on 03/27/2024 at 3:41 pm.
